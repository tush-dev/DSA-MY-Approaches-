# DSA-MY-Approaches-
This repository documents my structured approach to solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. For each problem, I include understanding, brute-force logic, optimized solution, and time-space complexity analysis. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, recognize patterns, and build strong fundamentals for technical interviews .
