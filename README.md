Welcome to my DSA learning repository.

This repository is not just a collection of solutions — it is a structured journal of how I approach and solve Data Structures & Algorithms problems.

For every problem, I document:
	•	🧠 Problem Understanding – Breaking down the question and identifying constraints
	•	🐢 Brute-Force Approach – Initial logic and baseline solution
	•	⚡ Optimized Solution – Improved strategy with better efficiency
	•	📊 Time & Space Complexity Analysis – Clear performance evaluation
	•	✍️ Key Learning Insights – Patterns, mistakes, and takeaways

The focus is on building strong problem-solving skills rather than just writing working code.
I aim to improve logical thinking, recognize patterns across problems, and develop interview-ready solutions.

This repository reflects my commitment to consistency — solving and analyzing problems regularly to strengthen fundamentals.

One problem at a time. Continuous improvement. 🚀
