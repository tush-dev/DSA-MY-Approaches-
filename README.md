## Welcome to my DSA Learning Repository

This repository is not just a collection of solutions — it is a structured journal of how I approach and solve Data Structures & Algorithms problems.

For every problem, I document:

- 🧠 **Problem Understanding** – Breaking down the question and identifying constraints  
- 🐢 **Brute-Force Approach** – Initial logic and baseline solution  
- ⚡ **Optimized Solution** – Improved strategy with better efficiency  
- 📊 **Time & Space Complexity Analysis** – Clear performance evaluation  
- ✍️ **Key Learning Insights** – Patterns, mistakes, and takeaways  

---

The focus is on building strong problem-solving skills rather than just writing working code.  

I aim to improve logical thinking, recognize patterns across problems, and develop interview-ready solutions.

This repository reflects my commitment to consistency — solving and analyzing problems regularly to strengthen fundamentals.

**One problem at a time. Continuous improvement. 🚀**
